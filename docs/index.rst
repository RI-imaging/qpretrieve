The qpretrieve Python library provides algorithms for the retrieval
of quantitative phase information from experimental data, based on
Fourier analysis (peak detection in Fourier space and filtering). Currently,
qpretrieve only supports the analysis of holograms (with the characteristic
fringe patterns).
If you are looking for a library to load quantitative phase data from disk,
please have a look at :ref:`qpformat <qpformat:index>`.
The :ref:`qpimage <qpimage:index>` library can be used for further processing
(e.g. background correction).
This is the documentation of qpretrieve version |release|.
